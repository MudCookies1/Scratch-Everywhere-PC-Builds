# Scratch Everywhere! PC Builds
## -- == A Place for (unofficial) PC builds of Scratch Everywhere! == --

Updates will (probably) be VERY inconsistent, so it may be a while for new builds to come out.
All release tags will be named after Scratch Everywhere's.

## ORIGINAL PROJECT:
https://github.com/ScratchEverywhere/ScratchEverywhere

## HOW TO USE
PROJECTS: Place projects in the "scratch-everywhere" folder; they NEED to be in the SB3 format.
APPLICATION:
    LINUX: Just run the file! (Double click, obviously)
    WINDOWS: I personally haven't tested on windows, but you (probably) just need to rename it to an EXE, as it is cross-platform
    MAC: Run the file, I believe
